# Lab 7: Refugee Stats with Dictionaries
### Due: 10/11/2019

1. Review the data table located under the **_Refugee camps by country and population_** section: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp

2. Create a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs consisting of a country name and an integer that represents the number of refugees in refugee camps in the selected country, for a year of your choice. The dictionary should represent country names as keys and the population as values.

3. Define a function that will print out just the countries' names, by looping through the keys of your dictionary.

4. Define a function that will print out just the populations, by looping through the values of your dictionary.

5. Print out a series of statements telling how many refugees are in each country: "CountryX has 1234567 refugees."

Revise your output, if necessary. Make sure there is an introductory sentence or comment describing the output for each loop you write.
